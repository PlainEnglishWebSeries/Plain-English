                        <p>Allyssa Bainbridge is a 10 year old actress who likes reading and writing as well as acting and performing. Allyssa started out performing in plays at her school and found that she like being on stage and using her 
                        imagination to portray characters. Allyssa now attends acting class with Gray Studios in San Diego.</p>
                        <p>Since starting her more formal acting career, Allyssa has found that she enjoys being on set and in front of the camera even more than being on stage. She is quick to memorize lines and has a quick wit, even though 
                        she is still too young to realize it.</p>
                        <p>Her screen credits include Little Whispers: The Vow, Save The Date, Shifting Gears, Invisible, Resilience, Florence and Evelyn web series pilot, Preparing for the Apocalypse, and
